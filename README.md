##  Dataset Structure

The data is divided into 5 related tables, simulating a normalized database schema:

1. ** Category Data**  
   - `category_id`, `category_name`  
   - Defines the main product categories (e.g., iPhone, Mac, Accessories)

2. ** Products Data**  
   - `product_id`, `product_name`, `category_id`, `launch_date`, `price`  
   - Links each product to its category and tracks launch date and pricing

3. ** Sales Data**  
   - `sale_id`, `sale_date`, `store_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`  
   - Transaction-level data capturing store sales over time

4. ** Stores Data**  
   - `store_id`, `store_name`, `city`, `country`  
   - Geographical mapping of store locations

5. ** Warranty Data**  
   - `claim_id`, `claim_date`, `sale_id`, `repair_status`  
   - Tracks customer claims and repair statuses post-purchase
